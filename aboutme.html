  <h2> Our mission </h2>
    <p> Hello! I'm Inchara, a highschool student at Canyon Crest Academy. I've always wanted to be part of the mission to help prevent fake news. So here I am! PurplePineapples is a platform I made for people who wish to write about real news be able to do just that. </p>
    <p> Here at PurplePineapples, we strive to inform everyone, whether they be reading or skimming, about current events. Our team consists of highschoolers, all of who share a common goal. Spread real news. </p>
  <h3> What is our mission? </h3>
    <p> Though I'm pretty sure I explained this in <i> Our Mission </i>, we strive to spread real, trustworthy news in an easy and readable format. Written by highschoolers and read by you. </p>
  <h4> Our Team </h4>
    <p> The main team here consists of me, Inchara J., Nivi C., Yaj Jhajhria., and Hans Yang.
